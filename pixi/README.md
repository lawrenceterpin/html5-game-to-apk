## PixiJS v5 Set Up With NPM and Webpack

Here you can see how to set up your PixiJS v5 project using NPM, Webpack and separate consumable PixiJS components.

Just for example I made a spinning sprite to show how to use Sprite class which is imported as a separate component.

Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Run on http://localhost:3000:
```
npm start
```

#### Building

Development build:
```
npm run build
```

Production build:
```
npm run production
```
